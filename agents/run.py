# 1. Choose your model:
#    'gemini' -> Your "CEO". This is a complex new feature.
MODEL_TO_USE = "gemini" 

# 2. Define your task:
YOUR_PROMPT = """
I need to add a new 'GET /posts' endpoint to 'app/main.py'.

This endpoint should:
1. Take 'skip' and 'limit' query parameters, with defaults of 0 and 10.
2. Import a new function 'get_posts' from 'app/crud.py'.
3. Call 'get_posts(db=db, skip=skip, limit=limit)'.
4. Return a list of 'schemas.Post' objects.
5. Also, I need the 'get_posts' function added to 'app/crud.py'. This function 
   should query and return all posts from the 'models.Post' table, using 
   skip and limit for pagination.

IMPORTANT: You must modify *two* files. Your response must contain
the complete, new 'app/crud.py' file first, followed by the
complete, new 'app/main.py' file that includes the new endpoint.

CRITICAL: Your response MUST be only the raw, valid code. 
Do not add *any* other text, explanations, or markdown fences like ```.
"""

# 3. Define the output file:
#    Since the AI is generating two files, we'll save its raw
#    response to a text file for you to copy/paste from.
